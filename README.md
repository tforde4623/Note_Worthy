 ### Difficulties
 One of the main difficulties that I faced while writing this application was in promises. In one part I was having to use multiple functions with callbacks inside of eachother, which got a little challenging. But once I sat down and took a second to think about it. I solved my problem pretty quickly. I really did enjoy making this application, and then seeing my work come to life after it was deployed.
